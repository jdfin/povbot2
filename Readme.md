## 3d Print Files

Look in 3d_print folder to find a 3mf file with the chassis , camera holder and wheels ready to print.

## Software

Setting up video streaming and remote control is very easy.

Clone this repo to a raspberry pi, navigate to web_server/keyandvid/

From there run "python app.py" and the web server will start

Then you can navigate to your pis ip address using a computer on the same wifi. Use port 8000.

For example : 192.168.0.186:8000 and you should see your video stream. The robot can be steered using the WASD keys on your keyboard

## PCB Files

The hat was designed in Kicad 7. All project files are in kicad_files.

The board was made and assembled by PCBway. If you wish to get your own board assembled using PCBway look in kicad_files/pcbway_production for all of the required PCB manufacture and assembly files, ready for upload to JLCPCB.

## Youtube video

I made a short video explaining the project. It is available here:
