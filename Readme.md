## Software

Setting up video streaming and remote control is very easy.

Clone this repo to a raspberry pi, navigate to web_server/keyandvid/

From there run "python app.py" and the web server will start

Then you can navigate to your pis ip address using a computer on the same wifi. Use port 8000.

For example : 192.168.0.186:8000 and you should see your video stream:
